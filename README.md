+ Hi, I’m @chloescoding
+ I’m interested in machine learning. I want to make the user experience feel more natural when choosing products or services.
+ I’m currently learning python, but am not limiting myself at all
+ I’m looking to collaborate on most things that employ my skillset, can be put in a porfolio, or just interest me. Not looking to do paid work for free.
+ You can reach me on here, if further contact is required, I will give it out at my discretion
